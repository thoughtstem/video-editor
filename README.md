This is a Racket-based tool for writing video editing scripts on top of the MLT framework.  I'd recommend using "#lang video" instead of this package if you want to work with videos in Racket.

This is a smaller, more streamlined, less fully-featured set of tools that fits my own video production pipeline needs.

It doesn't do much right now except write out the most basic of Melt XML files and play them.
